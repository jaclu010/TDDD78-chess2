		Welcome to Chess 2!

	This is a two player game that is almost as the original chess but
	much better.

	The game i controlled by the mouse and to move the chess pieces
	you press on one of them to select it, then you can move to any of the
	light up green squares, by pressing on it.

	This game also features special abilities for the different chess pieces.
	E.g can the queen use a laser to damage the enemys pieces. To be able to
	use the abilitys the piece has to gain AP which it does by damaging
	enemy pieces. If a piece has enought AP to use an ability, you can press

	press on one of the light up yellow squares to use the ability.

	You can change the size of the game by changing the static
	int SQUARE_SIDE in the class GlobalVars.

	The game ends when you kill the enemy's king.
